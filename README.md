### Project Description
This program is a simple blackjack game that uses a single deck and allows the user to hit or stay on each hand.  The player may win, lose, or push on each hand.  If either the player or dealer is dealt blackjack, the winner is announced and the hand ends.  If both the player and dealer are dealt blackjack, the hand is a push.  The program maintains a count of cards remaining in the deck, and prompts the player to approve a shuffle when fewer than 15 cards remain.
